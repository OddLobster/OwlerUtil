in the root directory clone the following repos:
owler:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/Owler
owler utilities:
    git clone https://github.com/OddLobster/OwlerUtil
url-frontier:
    git clone https://github.com/crawler-commons/url-frontier.git

generate corpus embedding file from web data:
    navigate to OwlerUtil/SeedGathering/seeds.py
    run: python seeds.py
    this will generate a seeds_earth_observation.txt file, that can be used as starting seeds (the reference corpus embedding will be generated from the text of these urls as well)
    Additionally, the script will generate a corpus_embedding_d_0.hdf5 file
        move this into the owler repository under data/model/  (create folders if they dont exist)
    The seeds URLs for the crawl should currently be in the root directory of Owler (where all of the dockerfiles are) (will refactor this soon)
        the file has to be named: seeds.txt (or change it in the Dockerfile.owler)

run owler:
    change to owler root directory and run: make run
